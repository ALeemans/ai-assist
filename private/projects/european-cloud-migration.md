# Move to European Cloud Storage

## 📋 Overview

Migrate all cloud storage away from Google and Microsoft to European privacy-focused alternatives.

## 🎯 Goals

- [ ] Research European cloud storage providers
- [ ] Evaluate options (storage space, price, features, privacy)
- [ ] Select primary provider
- [ ] Set up account and test
- [ ] Migrate Google Drive files
- [ ] Migrate OneDrive files
- [ ] Update backup workflows
- [ ] Cancel Google/Microsoft subscriptions

## 📝 Notes

### Current Storage

- **Google Drive**: [Note current usage and size]
- **OneDrive**: [Note current usage and size]
- **Total**: [Total GB needed]

### European Alternatives to Research

- **Proton Drive** (Switzerland) - Privacy-focused, encrypted
- **Tresorit** (Switzerland) - Zero-knowledge encryption
- **MEGA** (New Zealand, EU servers) - End-to-end encryption
- **pCloud** (Switzerland) - Lifetime plans available
- **Nextcloud** (Self-hosted, EU servers) - Full control
- **Internxt** (Spain) - Privacy-first, open source
- **Filen** (Germany) - Zero-knowledge encryption

### Key Requirements

- [ ] European-based (GDPR compliant)
- [ ] End-to-end encryption
- [ ] Desktop sync client
- [ ] Mobile apps
- [ ] Reasonable pricing
- [ ] Sufficient storage space
- [ ] Good performance

### Migration Plan

1. **Week 1-2**: Research and evaluation
2. **Week 3**: Sign up and test chosen provider
3. **Week 4**: Start migration (non-critical files first)
4. **Week 5-6**: Full migration
5. **Week 7**: Verify everything, cancel old subscriptions

## 💡 Ideas & Thoughts

- Consider self-hosted Nextcloud for maximum control?
- Keep some redundancy during transition
- Document what's stored where
- Update family/friends about new sharing methods
